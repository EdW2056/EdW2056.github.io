Hello, welcome back to my blog, I just wanted to give you a little update on something that I have been working on this last week. 
MY FIRST GAME! I am still working on it and it is pretty basic but it works and you can go download it and have a lot of fun with your friends!
You know the pong game, one of the first computer games to be written, I tried to create a version of my own, again very basic, but I do
hope you enjoy it!! All you have to do to play is unzip the zipped file, choose ether 64bit or 32bit, depending on your system
and click the .exe file!
